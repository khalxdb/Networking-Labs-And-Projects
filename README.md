# Networking-Labs-And-Projects
Practical networking projects and labs demonstrating IP addressing, routing, LAN/WAN setup, and network security skills from my Data Communications (COMP2250) course.

# Data Communications Portfolio (COMP2250)

This repository contains my practical work and major assignment from the **Data Communications** unit (COMP2250) at Macquarie University. The work demonstrates hands-on experience with networking concepts, protocols, IP addressing, routing, LAN/WAN topologies, network security, and network analysis.

## Practical Worksheets

Each practical worksheet covers different aspects of networking, including:

- IP addressing, subnetting, and routing calculations  
- LAN and WAN configuration  
- Network protocols and OSI model application  
- Packet analysis using tools like Wireshark  
- Network design and traffic analysis  

These practicals demonstrate my ability to configure, document, and analyse network systems in real-world scenarios.
